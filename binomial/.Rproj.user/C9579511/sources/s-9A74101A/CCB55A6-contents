## Overview
***
"binomial" is an R package that provides functions to compute basic probability functions and see plot the results of those computations.

* bin_variable() creates a binomial variable object of class "binvar".
* summary.binvar() displays the summary statistics of a particular binomial variable of class "binvar".This summary include the: 
    + mean
    + variance
    + mode
    + skewness
    + kurtosis
of the probability districution of the binomial variable.

## Motivation
***
This package has been developed for the purpose of a class project to illustrate the concepts behind the creation of an R package.

## Usage
***
```{r}
library(binomial)
library(DistributionUtils)
library(ggplot2)
# Building a random variiable, seeing its summary statistics
example_variable = bin_variable(4, 0.4)
example_variable
summary(example_variable)

# Creating a sample probability distribution by inputing number of successes, trials and probability
bin_probability(3, 4, 0.75)
# Viewing the probability distribution
ex_distribution = bin_distribution(4, 0.5)
# Plotting the distribution to study it visually
plot.bindis(ex_distribution)

#Creating a cumulative probability distribution, and plotting it
ex_cum = bin_cumulative(10, 0.6)
plot.bincum(ex_cum)
```
