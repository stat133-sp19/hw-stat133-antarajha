## Cooking Recipe
### *Silky, Decadent Old-School Chocolate Mousse*
#### Ingredients
* 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate (no more than 60% cacao), chopped
* 3/4 stick (3 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces
* 3 large eggs, separated
* 1 tablespoon Cognac or other brandy (or swap with a liqueur of your choice)
* 1 cup very cold heavy or whipping cream
* 1/8 teaspoon salt

### Steps to cook it

Get out one large heatproof, two medium and one small mixing bowl and dust off your electric hand mixer.

Set the large bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water and melt the chocolate and butter in it, gently stirring it until smooth. Remove from heat. 

In the small bowl, beat yolks with your electric mixer until thick enough to form a ribbon that takes a few seconds to dissolve â€” this will take about two to four minutes to achieve. Whisk yolks into chocolate mixture along with Cognac, then cool to warm.

In one of the medium bowls, beat the cream with cleaned beaters until it just holds stiff peaks.

In the other medium bowl, beat the egg whites and salt with cleaned beaters until they just hold soft peaks.

Fold the whipped cream and beaten whites into the chocolate mixture, gently but thoroughly. Transfer to 8 (4 ounce) ramekins or one large serving bowl, or go restaurant-style, serving it in stemmed glasses with white or dark chocolate shavings on top.

## Euclidean Distance
### Definition [edit]
***
The **Euclidean distance** between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them (**pq**).
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = $(p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and **q** = $(q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$ d(p,q) = d(q,p) = \sqrt{ {q_1 - p_1}^2 + {q_2 - p_2}^2 + ... + {q_n - p_n}^2 } = \lVert1\rVert $$
$$                 = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} {q_i - p_i}^2  }. $$
The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$ \lVert{p}\rVert = \sqrt{ {p_1}^2 + {p_2}^2 + ... + {p_n}^2 } = \sqrt{p.p} $$

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
