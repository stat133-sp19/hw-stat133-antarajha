#Introduction
ANALYSIS OF GSW PLAYERS

This is an analysis of the performance of the starting 5 GSW players.

##Motivation
The Golden State Warriors capture the hearts of all sports fans in California, and being at UC Berkeley, we are not exempt. Thus, I have taken the initiative to analyze the performance of GSW and specifically of its 5 starting players.

##Background
The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association, as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. They are one of the most celebrated basketball teams ever!

For the Warriors, wild numbers are more than just wild. Some carry historical significance. Others lengthen their lead on a basketball world trying—and almost always failing—to keep up. 

##Data
The data that I have used combines a statistics about a variety of variables, right from their team details to the details of every shot they have taken (when was it taken? what kind of shot was it? did it go in?). Here is an example of data about Stephen Curry
```{r}
head(curry, n=5)
```

##Analysis
The analysis involved cleaning the data, adding columns to better categorize the date (by player name), generating charts that make the observations and analysis more clear, and combining tables.

Here is an example of a summary of data about Stephen Curry:

```{r}
summary(curry)
```

Further, here is some data regarding the 2 pointer shots made by players. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
twop_shooting
```

Further, here is some data regarding the 3 pointer shots made by players. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
threep_shooting
```

To get a better overall picture, here is some summarized data on overall shots made by players. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
effective_shooting
```

As you can see, Kevin Durant is the best effective shooter on the team, even though he is not the top 3 point shooter on the team.

###Image to Illustrate Shots Data
Here is an image that captures the main elements of the analysis about the shots made by each of the players:

```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/antarajha/Desktop/hw-stat133/workout01/images/gsw_shots_chart.png")
```

##Conclusion
I hope this report gave you a better insight into the performance of GSW Players! Kevin Durant is by far the most effective shooter on the GSW team. However, all players perform extremely well. I am sure GSW will have a fantastic season ahead with such great players who are performing so well.
